within the lab topology to communicate with the outside world.

Objectives

1. Create tags for later use with security policy rules

2. Create a basic Source NAT rule to allow outbound access

3. Create a corresponding Security Policy rule to permit the outbound traffic

4. Create a Destination NAT rule for the FTP server
