Title: Palo Alto Firewall Lab â€“ Security Profile Testing

Overview:
This lab focused on learning how to configure and test Palo Alto Security Profiles in a virtual environment using Virtual Wire mode. The main tasks included:

Setting up a Vulnerability Protection Profile

Configuring and testing a File Blocking Profile

Creating a "Danger Zone" using Virtual Wire

Generating simulated threats to observe firewall behavior

Key Activities:

Adjusted the lab-spg Security Profile Group to test different file-blocking actions

Ran ftp-brute.bat to simulate brute-force activity

Executed sh /tg/malware.sh to test malware detection

Observed and reviewed firewall logs to confirm detection and blocking

Takeaways:
The lab provided practical insight into how Palo Alto firewalls detect and respond to different types of threats based on configured security profiles.
